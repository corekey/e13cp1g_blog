My research interest is in the analysis of potential threats in mission critical systems, e.g., digital healcare products, connected-automated vehicles, mobility services, telecommunication systems, and the development of countermeasures. I received PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University with a dissertation titled _“Securing Wi-Fi Access By Using Location-Aware Controls”_. I was a member of the Mobile, Embedded, Wireless Security group led by Dr. Patrick Tague.
